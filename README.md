# Hi there! 👋 I'm **Jingkang Yang**.

🎓 Currently pursuing a PhD in **Visual Perception and Reasoning**.

🔍 My research interests revolve around **Vision-Language Models** 🧠, **Embodied Agents** 🤖, and **Scene Graph Generation** 🕸. I am passionate about creating generalist AI models capable of understanding and interacting with complex visual data.

## 🚀 My Ongoing Research Projects:

- **Visual Generalist Models**: Developing models that process diverse visual data (e.g., images, videos, 3D, audio, IMU) to tackle various tasks in perception, reasoning, generation, robotics, and gaming. Notable projects include [**EgoLife**](https://egolife-ai.github.io/), [**Octopus**](https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/), [**FunQA**](https://funqa-benchmark.github.io/), and [**Otter**](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/Otter).

- **AI Safety for Foundation Models**: Investigating how to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs). A key contribution is the introduction of [**UPD**](https://github.com/AtsuMiyai/UPD) to withhold answers when faced with unsolvable questions.

## 🏆 Previous Contributions:

- **PSG Series (2022-2023)**: Led the development of the [**PSG**](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenPSG), [**PVSG**](https://github.com/LilyDaytoy/OpenPVSG), and [**PSG4D**](https://github.com/Jingkang50/PSG4D) models, focusing on relation modeling for scene understanding. I also collaborated on works like [**Relate-Anything**](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/RelateAnything) and [**PairNet**](https://github.com/king159/Pair-Net).

- **OOD Detection (2021-2022)**: Led a comprehensive [survey](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OODSurvey) and developed [**OpenOOD**](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD), a popular codebase for Out-of-Distribution detection in AI safety.

- **Prompt Tuning (2022)**: Contributed to foundational works like [**CoOp**](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp) and [**CoCoOp**](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp) for prompt tuning in vision-language models.
